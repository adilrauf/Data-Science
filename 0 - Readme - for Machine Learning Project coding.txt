This are varies files I used for Python code under Machine Learning.

The code is good on Python 2.7.

The Project is a Machine learning on a Data Set based on information of Sepals and Petals.

CSV file data set is downloaded. Visualizations were used to see the for data on Box and Whistek Plots.

Evaluated various algorithms on data and see their accuracies on unseen data.

Separated data on training data in the X-train and Y-train.

Accuracy was estimated on the 10-fold cross validation, used scoring variable when run, build and evaluate each model set.

Ran 6 models and estimated the accuracies of each and based on that selected that particular algorithm and the best Model.

KNN algorithm was found the most accurate model that was tested.
